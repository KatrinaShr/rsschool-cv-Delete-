                <p>
                    I enjoy programming. Now I am changing my field of activity, from business analysis on the site. For
                    a reason to write what I like code, to execute functions in JS. Now programming is a hobby for me,
                    so I spend most of my time on it. My goal is to learn pure JavaScript at a good level and. I want to
                    work under the guidance of an experienced developer to gain hands-on experience.
